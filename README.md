# PopcornTime


## **Description**

The app was developed as a small project used to understand, learn and practise with UIKit during an educational path.

PopcornTime is an iOS app that allows movie lovers to check trending movies and keep track of them in a personal list.
It has been developed in UIKit and uses the The Movie Database (TMDb) API to retrieve data and posters of movies. 
It consists in a tab bar that allows flat navigation among two different views: one that allows the user to check trending movies and save them as favourite, made in UIKit; the other one where the user finds all its favourite movies, made in SwiftUI and integrated in UIKit.
